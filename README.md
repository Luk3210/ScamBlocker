This browser extension aims to prevent scams involving remote desktop programs.
To install:
1) Download the .zip, extract it, and put it somewhere safe. (In some cases, you may need to remove the readme from the folder.)
2) Go to your browser and open the extensions tab.
3) Find the developer mode button and switch it on. Then, find the button that says "Load unpacked" and click it. Then navigate to and select the browser extension's folder.

Note: I would put it on the Google store but I don't want to spend money on it just for no one to use it so if you do end up using it please fill out this form: https://forms.gle/fP2mt3K2gyfqpaiE8
